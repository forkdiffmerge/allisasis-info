**High Altitude Map of Reality:**

 This is a distillation of insights gleaned from 5 years of intensive research, 
both subjective and objective, into the nature of reality. It was developed 
in collaboration with my reseach partner John Ringland. The colour coding of 
the nodes helps with concept navigation, pink is the manifest realm, green 
is the phenomenal realm and orange is the realm of reality generative processes.

## All being "as it is".

### 
 _If we are to transcend the "tower of babel" effect that our current methods of cognition and communication commonly suffer from, we need to explore new ways of thinking and representing knowledge. _

###   

### 
_We now not only communicate with other people, networks of people and groups but also with computers, networks of computers and the www. Some of the methods developed to enable optimal flow of information between computers and networks are highly efficient and can be adapted to the realm of interpersonal communication, especially when we are focussed on topics rather than socialising._

###   

### 
_Part of the evolution of consciousness is its drive toward ever more inclusive, holistic states of being as each stage transcends and includes the previous stages. We are now at a stage where linear, language based knowledge sharing is being integrated into a larger context. Creating and communicating through concept maps, which when logically consistent are a form of ontological representation which is fairly human friendly can allow the information we share to be useful in a larger context through integration into the evolving semantic web._

###   

### 
_The initial purpose of this diagram and the set of related concepts which it represents is to explore holistic, systemic methods for information representation and retrieval. It is an attempt to build bridges between the current linear thinking and communication methods with which we are familiar, and the logical, systemic methods used when languages become more abstract, yet the information conveyed is done so more accurately (for example; mathematics, computer codes, ontologies or music)._
